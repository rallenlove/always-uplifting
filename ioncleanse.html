  <div class="container-left">

    <p>Recall the way your body felt the last time you stood next to a waterfall or walked along a beach with the waves
      breaking at your feet. You breathed deeper into your lungs and abdomen; your brain cleared and the pains in your
      joints subsided. You felt relaxed and at peace with the world.</p>
    <p>These invigorating reactions were caused by the ionization of trillions of water molecules as they crashed to
      earth.</p>
    <p>The IonCleanse® creates precisely the same environment as the walk along the beach, only more powerfully because
      your feet are in direct contact with the ions being manufactured in the water. Place your feet in the water and
      within seconds, millions of ions enter your body and begin to neutralize these tissue acid wastes.</p>
    <p>In today's toxic environment, tissue acid wastes, chemical and heavy metal residues build up in the body faster
      than ever before, resulting in a greater incidence of allergies, mental, and physical incapacitation. Acid wastes
      attack joints, tissues, muscles, organs, glands and the body’s immune system causing minor to major dysfunction.
    </p>
    <p>Pimples, rashes, dark circles under the eyes, allergies, respiratory issues, swollen joints, yellow, green and
      blotched complexions often indicate a buildup of tissue acid wastes inside the body. Many prescription medicines
      have harmful and unwanted side effects. IonCleanse® foot baths have been shown to substantially reduce and even
      eliminate these conditions.</p>
    <p>The IonCleanse® provides a comfortable purification support system. Your body will feel lighter. You will think
      more clearly, have more energy and enjoy a greater sense of well-being.</p>

  <h1 class="heading royal" style="text-align: center;">How the IonCleanse&reg; Works</h1>
  <div class="container-left">
    <p>An ion is a charged atom that has gained or lost an electron which creates a magnetic field capable of attaching
      to and neutralizing oppositely charged particles. These neutralized particles are extracted from the body through
      the process called osmosis. Osmosis is a scientific term that is used to describe the movement of particles
      through a membrane from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration. In this case, the
      higher concentration refers to the ion field that is set up by placing the array into the water while running the
      unit.</p>
    <p>The array is placed into the water alongside the feet, while the power supply delivers a low level direct current
      to the array. This causes the metals within the array in combination with water to generate positively and
      negatively charged ions by separating oxygen and hydrogen in the water.</p>
    <p>Because of poor diet and high stress, we tend to accumulate and store excessive quantities of waste products.
      <br>
      The particles, fat, and mucous residues found in the water after bathing reflect the wastes that have left the
      body during the 30 minute session.</p>
    <p>The IonCleanse® is a high quality, reliable, FCC compliant, safety tested, and internationally certified product.
    </p>
    <p>All healing traditions - Egyptian, Native American, Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Chinese, Shamanic - except Western
      Medicine offer body purification as a means of healing and avoiding disease.</p>

    <p>The above photos show the results of independent IonCleanse® sessions. The photo on the left shows the results
      after the unit was run for 30 minutes using the array system, along with a person's feet submerged in the water
      for the entire session. The photo on the right shows that many more colors and solids are present as compared to
      the baseline session. Individual results vary as you can see in the next set of pictures marked with before and
      after.</p>
