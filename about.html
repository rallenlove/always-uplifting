      <p>
        I initially sought out Jin Shin Jyutsu as a means to recover from the terminal medical diagnosis of ovarian cancer that had metastasized into other female organs, (ovaries, uterus and cervix) with a tumor in the ovary that could burst at any moment becoming fatal in and of itself. After about 4 months of receiving Jin Shin Jyutsu sessions and doing daily self-help I received a clean bill of health with absolutely no cancer cells left in my body and the tumor was completely gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the first month of receiving the Jin Shin Jyutsu sessions I started experiencing an enhancement of my mental clarity and a strong sense of self coming forth. It brought forth the courage within me to make the decision to leave my employment career of 10+ years, (which was very stressful, unfulfilling, but paid the bills, not to mention the fact that everyone around me thought I was crazy) and start my own business in a field that was much more uplifting and fulfilling to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to my being diagnosed with the cancer and related issues I had been medically diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and the beginnings of Crones disease (which were both hereditary issues in my family). It was recommended that I dramatically change my diet to reduce the symptoms and to learn to live with the labels. I had also been living with extreme migraine headaches during the five previous years, as a result of a soft tissue injury from a car accident. After seeing many doctors and specialists, (I had even been to the Mayo Clinic) and taught bio-feedback, given many different types of medications with nothing helping to relieve the headaches, not to mention eliminating them all together, I was told that I would need to find a way to live life with them. This was impossible and unacceptable to me. I received acupuncture and chiropractic treatment regularly and this did seem to alleviate the pain but still did not eliminate the headaches all together. Since receiving the Jin Shin Jyutsu sessions for the cancer and related projects I have not had a migraine headache and stopped having the symptoms related to the Crones disease and the IBS without having to dramatically change my diet.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have since developed a deep respect and awe for the art and have become a Jin Shin Jyutsu practitioner. Jin Shin Jyutsu has had, and still continues to have, a profound effect upon my life, as it does with most who come in contact with it.
