      The Ultimate in Water Technology - No filters or cartridges to replace.
      Various units available for various uses (shower, sink, garden, whole
      house etc.) that structure your water. The units raise the pH to 7.0-7.5,
      the balanced hydrogen potential for a long healthy life. To make sure you
      always have balanced water when you travel, there is also a portable
      Structured Water Unit that can be carried with you so you always have
      balanced water. Despite what you may have heard — much of the tap water,
      de-ionized water and even bottled water has a pH of around 5.5-6.5. The
      long term effect of this acidic water is that it causes the buildup of
      free radicals in the body, which are the source of aging, cancer and the
      destruction of healthy cells. Not only can most filter systems remove
      almost everything from water, they also remove water's aliveness, leaving
      one with essentially 'dead' water. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.
      The Natural Action Structured Water Unit softens water while leaving in
      all the healthful minerals standard water softeners and reverse osmosis
      systems remove. Click link for products, product information and
      testimonials.
