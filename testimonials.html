        I can actually feel the energy moving through my body, particularly into areas that have been blocked. Sessions are very calming, very energizing, very healing, all at the same time.

        I have sessions to get me out of bad moods and relieve tension/aches in my body. Sessions also help me think clearer. One session can completely eliminate symptoms from a hangover. I have also healed a toothache, swollen glands and the flu by getting sessions.

        After seeing several doctors & specialists I was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Given 4-6 months to live. No treatment offered due to my age (81), just pain medication. Had 10 sessions. Went back to doctor a month later, they wouldn’t re-test (didn’t think there was a reason to) so I found a new doctor to test. He found no cancer cells, just fluid in the stomach. That was in 2003.

        I had fluid in my knee cap, doctors were considering draining the area or orthoscopic surgery. I had 3 Jin Shin sessions in 2 days and the pain was relieved immediately. Two days later my knee was back to normal and hasn’t been a problem since.

        Sessions relieve my body aches and pains and depression. After receiving a session I am happy of heart, feel lighter, have hopefulness and have the strength to continue on in life.

        Go into the session feeling tired and heavy. Leave the session feeling light and refreshed. Rejuvenation of the body and spirit. Helps bring back mental clarity.

        I discovered the curative powers of Jin Shin this last year when I experienced a sudden onset of gallstones. Since I had never had any problems with gallstones in my past I was very alarmed at the pain and discomfort this condition afforded. I was all prepared to wade through the conventional medical world when I mentioned my pain to Vicki. We embarked together on 5 sessions of Jin Shin and a temporarily altered diet plan. To my surprise and gratitude the pain subsided and disappeared within two weeks and I passed the gallstones on my own without surgery!!! I have been very impressed with the potential healing qualities of Jin Shin.

        Diagnosed with Bells Palsy. Doctor exhausted treatment options & still I had the problem. After 2 sessions the Bells Palsy left (I felt it leave). Sessions help me breathe better, see and feel clearer.

        I was diagnosed with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). I went to see several doctors, including a specialist. I tried multiple medications, and even dramatically changed my diet. I did not see significant improvements until I received Jin Shin sessions. After only a few sessions my symptoms started to improve. After 7 or 8 sessions I felt almost 100% better. Now it only takes only 1 or 2 sessions to feel immediately better. I would recommend Jin Shin to anyone who is suffering with any type of pain or illness.
