						Jyutsu Phisio-Philisophy is a dynamic healing art from 
						ancient tradition. Brought by Mary Burmeister to 
						America, a gift from Jiro Murai of Japan. Murai decoded 
						this Art from the Kojiki (Record of Ancient Things-AD 
						712) and other ancient records contained within the 
						Imperial Archives of Japan.</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jin Shin 
						Jyutsu works wonderfully with people and animals alike.&nbsp;</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jin Shin 
						Jyutsu sessions can be done in person or remotely.</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Each body 
						has a main revitalizing energy that follows a 
						circulatory pattern. This energy revitalizes all of our 
						“individualized” body function energy circulation 
						patterns. The rhythm of this energy cannot be destroyed, 
						but hereditary issues and abuses to the body knowingly 
						or unknowingly can affect the supply of the energy for 
						the proper function of our body energy circulation 
						patterns. The body is affected by the air, food, action, 
						thoughts, etc. that make up each moment of our lives. 
						When harmony becomes disrupted or imbalanced it becomes 
						the cause for various tensions, illnesses and diseases. 
						Physical symptoms of distress and pain are your body’s 
						way of telling you it is out of harmony.&nbsp;</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">
						Subconsciously and/or unconsciously we create complex 
						and sometimes mysterious mechanisms to protect us from 
						traumatic and stressful experiences. These mechanisms 
						run silently below the surface of our conscious mind as 
						coping skills that help us endure and survive difficult 
						events, situations and chronically painful conditions 
						throughout our lives. However, their repetitive 
						application often leads to thoughts, feelings, belief 
						systems, patterns and actions that create disharmony and 
						can lead to illness or diseases that rob us of living 
						our fullest potential in life. Each moment of our lives 
						is recorded in our cellular memory. The cellular memory 
						records stressful or traumatic events you have 
						experienced and, very important, the coping skills you 
						called up or invented to respond to the stress. &nbsp;At the 
						time, that particular coping skill was the best tool you 
						had available. For example, if a child grew up in an 
						environment of extreme criticism, s/he may have coped by 
						disconnecting from their emotions or becoming 
						self-critical as well. &nbsp;While that subconscious 
						mechanism helped them get through their childhood, most 
						likely it has been the cause of later problems with 
						self-confidence or trying to form intimate 
						relationships. That cellular history is still active 
						somewhere within you. Hyper-vigilant, whenever you 
						encounter a situation connected in some way to that 
						earlier experience, at some level, alarm bells go off 
						and your subconscious initiates behavior for you to 
						avoid or escape the moment. &nbsp;When you harmonize negative 
						belief systems and patterns you stop that 
						self-sabotaging behavior and often realize numerous ways 
						in which you feel better being in the world.</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jin Shin 
						Jyutsu is energy work (sometimes referred to as energy 
						medicine or vibrational healing) that brings the body, 
						mind and spirit into Harmony. It clears and brings 
						balance to the body’s energies, allowing you to 
						function better, feel better and facilitates our own 
						profound healing capacity. It is a valuable compliment 
						to conventional healing methods, inducing relaxation and 
						reducing the effects of stress. It can be used alone or 
						safely in conjunction with any other therapy or 
						medication. A Jin Shin Jyutsu session lasts about an 
						hour. It uses simple hands-on sequences to restore 
						emotional equilibrium, relieve pain, and release the 
						causes of both acute and chronic conditions.&nbsp;</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jin Shin 
						Jyutsu employs twenty-six Energy Safety Locks on the 
						body that are located along the pathways that feed life 
						into our bodies. When one or more of these Energy Safety 
						Locks become blocked, the blockage or stagnation will 
						disrupt the flow and eventually disharmonize the 
						complete path of the energy flow. Holding these locks in 
						combinations will bring balance, physically, mentally, 
						emotionally and spiritually.&nbsp;</span></td>

						<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jin Shin Jyutsu does not involve massage, manipulation 
						of bones or muscles or the use of drugs or substances. 
						It is a gentle art, employed by placing the fingertips 
						over clothing on designated locks, to harmonize and 
						restore the energy flow. When the body’s energy is 
						circulating freely it will be without disharmony and one 
						can enjoy a life of longevity, happiness and 
						benevolence.</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">We do not 
						diagnose in Jin Shin Jyutsu. We look for the harmony. 
						There are no problems or big scary labels. Everything is 
						viewed as a project. Projects are viewed as a process 
						that leads to a desirable result. Problems are limited; 
						projects are open-ended and can be fun.&nbsp;</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jin Shin 
						Jyutsu has wonderful side effects. Often, when receiving 
						sessions to return the body back to health from a 
						particular label or project one will find that other 
						disharmonies will also disappear that were not part of 
						one’s initial intended result.&nbsp;<br>
						Jin Shin Jyutsu will help you to leave the past behind, 
						let go of the fear and worry of the future and help you 
						to stay in the present. For those who choose to become 
						actively responsible for maintaining their own health 
						and happiness, Jin Shin Jyutsu is an excellent means to 
						that end. In dealing with stress, chronic pain, critical 
						illness or more recent health disharmonies and/or for 
						health maintenance, mental clarity and high energy 
						level, Jin Shin Jyutsu is a simple and powerful tool, 
						available to all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth 
						is that within each one of us lies the power to cast all 
						misery aside and to KNOW complete Peace and Oneness – to 
						BE that beautiful creation of perfect harmony.&nbsp;</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jin Shin 
						Jyutsu sessions, demonstrations and lectures offer a way 
						of Being to help yourself, help others and to know your 
						true magnificence. In experiencing Jin Shin Jyutsu one’s 
						insight of innate potential and foundation for expanding 
						one’s awareness and understanding are awakened.</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Energy 
						medicine, alternative medicine and all holistic healing 
						modalities work from the inside out. The body will work 
						to harmonize the cause which ultimately eliminates the 
						symptoms that have manifested in the physical body. 
						Disharmonies that have manifested into physical symptoms 
						and or illness often have many layers to them.&nbsp;</span><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">There are 
						no set rules or limits on how to use or schedule 
						sessions. It is best to discuss this with your healing 
						facilitator, contemplate how you feel and then make your 
						decision. Everybody is different and every body is 
						different. Therefore it is not possible to predict how 
						many sessions it will take for you to experience the 
						results that you are seeking. Each session received goes 
						deeper into the body and into your beingness clearing 
						and harmonizing any accumulations and disharmony. This 
						being said, there are a few things to keep in mind when 
						scheduling sessions….</span></td>
